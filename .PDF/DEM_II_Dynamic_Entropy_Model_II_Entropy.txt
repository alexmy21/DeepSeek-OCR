DEM II: Dynamic Entropy Model II — Entropy Collapse and Emergent Probabilities in Recursive Open Systems

By Mitchell D. McPhetridge
A Theory of Observer-Dependent Entropy Collapse and Dynamic Bias Emergence

⸻

Abstract

This paper proposes a formal expansion of the Dynamic Entropy Model (DEM), introducing DEM II, a post-Shannonian framework that models entropy as an emergent, recursive, and observer-sensitive flow within open systems. DEM II resolves key limitations of classical Shannon entropy by incorporating the dynamics of observation collapse, emergent probability distributions, and chaotic environmental coupling.

We demonstrate that entropy in real-world systems—unlike in closed, static experiments—is not a passive function of known probabilities but a feedback-driven, evolving property shaped by interactions, collapse events, and environmental entanglement. Using mathematical formalism, conceptual analogies (e.g., Schrödinger’s cat vs. the falling tree), and system modeling, we redefine entropy as an actively regulated, emergent structure: not merely disorder, but a driver of adaptation and complexity.

DEM II integrates tools from:
	•	Information theory (entropy metrics, KL divergence),
	•	Control theory (feedback laws, Lyapunov functions),
	•	Stochastic dynamics (master equations, observation-modified transition rates),
	•	AI and computational cognition (entropy-modulated learning and bias correction),
	•	Philosophy of physics (observer-effect, collapse, and measurement).

Core Contributions

1. Entropy Collapse Model (ECM)

Defines a dynamic entropy gradient model that accounts for observer interaction, causing re-weighting of probabilities and entropy reduction post-observation:

H(t) = -\sum_{i} p_i(t|O_{1..t}) \ln p_i(t|O_{1..t})

Where O_{1..t} is the observation history that conditions probability evolution.

2. Observation-Induced Probability Reweighting

Models how entropy flows are influenced by collapse events that restrict available outcomes and shift system trajectory:

p_i(t+\Delta t) = f(p_i(t), O_t, E(t))

Where:
	•	O_t: Observation collapse at time t,
	•	E(t): Environmental state.

This framework formalizes real-world biases as dynamic, emergent effects—not as system flaws, but as part of entropy’s regulatory function.

3. Entropy-Feedback Control Mechanism

Introduces a recursive feedback signal derived from entropy flux:

\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \sum_j \left[ W_{ji} p_j - W_{ij} p_i \right] + u_i(t), \quad u_i(t) = -\lambda \left( \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} \right)

This term steers entropy toward desired dynamic states, enabling entropy engineering across AI, robotics, ecosystems, and physical systems.

Simulation Roadmap (PyTorch/NumPy Hybrid)

Goal: Compare classical Shannon entropy flow with DEM II entropy under:
	•	Biased vs unbiased starting distributions,
	•	Observation sequences (observation-induced collapse),
	•	Feedback entropy controllers (regulators like Maxwell’s Demon),
	•	Open system dynamics (external perturbations injected mid-simulation).

Simulation Outputs:
	•	Entropy over time (Shannon vs DEM II),
	•	Probability distribution trajectories (with/without collapse),
	•	Lyapunov function decay rates under entropy control,
	•	Bias emergence graphs over time (in dynamic vs static systems).

A detailed synthesis and technical breakdown of my framework:


I. Time-Dependent Entropy as a Dynamic State Variable

Core Entropy Evolution Equation

You define a dynamic entropy flow in the system as:

H(t) = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i(t) \ln p_i(t)

The differential version:

\frac{dH}{dt} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{dp_i}{dt} \ln p_i(t)

This links entropy flux directly to probability evolution, grounding entropy in real-time system dynamics.

Implications
	•	Entropy is no longer static (Shannonian), but time-sensitive and feedback-reactive.
	•	The sign of \frac{dH}{dt} represents entropy production or reduction—central to thermodynamics and control.

II. Probabilistic Evolution: Master & Fokker–Planck Equations

1. Discrete Systems: Master Equation

\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \sum_{j \neq i} [W_{ji} p_j - W_{ij} p_i]
	•	This models state transitions in an open Markov process.
	•	When the system satisfies detailed balance, entropy increases until equilibrium.

2. Continuous Systems: Fokker–Planck Equation

\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot [A(x,t) p(x,t)] + \frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 [D(x,t) p(x,t)]
	•	Encodes probability density flow with drift and diffusion—ideal for modeling diffusion-like uncertainty.

Entropy via Master Equation

\frac{dH}{dt} = -\sum_{i,j} [W_{ji} p_j - W_{ij} p_i] \ln p_i
	•	Captures the competitive tension between spreading and concentrating probability mass.

III. Entropy Feedback Control

Controlled Dynamics

\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \sum_{j} [W_{ji} p_j - W_{ij} p_i] + u_i(t)
Where u(t) is a feedback control signal derived from:
	•	Current entropy
	•	Target distribution p^*
	•	Gradient-based objectives

Stability via Lyapunov Function

Choose:
V(t) = D_{KL}(p(t) \parallel p^) = \sum_i p_i(t) \ln \frac{p_i(t)}{p_i^}

Control law:
u_i(t) = -\lambda \left( \ln \frac{p_i(t)}{p_i^*} \right) p_i(t)

This ensures:
	•	\frac{dV}{dt} \leq 0 (Lyapunov-stable)
	•	Convergence toward ordered, low-entropy distributions or desired configurations.

IV. Entropy Engineering: Optimal Control Perspective

Cost Functionals
	•	Entropy Minimization:
J = H(T) \quad \text{or} \quad J = \int_0^T H(t)\, dt
	•	Entropy Maximization:
Encourage exploration, e.g. in reinforcement learning or evolutionary search.

Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle

Apply this to compute the optimal control u(t) that steers the system along a desired entropy trajectory:
	•	Use Hamiltonian formalism with co-state variables \lambda_i(t)
	•	Satisfy canonical stationarity conditions
	•	Account for constraints: normalization, bounds, energy limits

Examples
	•	RL: SAC optimizes:
\mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_t r_t + \alpha H(\pi(\cdot|s_t)) \right]
Entropy promotes policy diversity and reduces premature convergence.
	•	Quantum Control: Optimize unitary + decoherent operators to minimize von Neumann entropy.
	•	Robotics: Control planners that adapt entropy for exploration (high) or precision (low).

VI. DEM and DREM – Synergistic Architecture

When DEM and DREM are paired:
	•	DEM controls dynamic entropy via external feedback.
	•	DREM adds recursive internal feedback from previous entropic states.

Together, they model learning systems that:
	•	Sense, regulate, and evolve entropy.
	•	Adaptively self-organize under complexity constraints.
	•	Integrate real-time feedback and memory-based recursion.

This composite architecture is foundational for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), adaptive autonomy, and intelligent self-regulation.

⸻

Conclusion: Toward a Science of Entropic Intelligence

Your formulation of DEM expands the toolkit for modeling and engineering intelligent systems, bridging:
	•	Information theory
	•	Control theory
	•	Thermodynamics
	•	Machine learning
	•	Biological adaptation

This positions entropy not as a destructive byproduct but as a **steerable dimension of

What I have  developed is not just a critique of Shannon’s entropy; it’s the foundation of a new theoretical model: one that bridges information theory, thermodynamics, observer effect physics, and AI systems modeling.

VII. Examples in Code — DEM II in Practice

This section demonstrates how core elements of DEM II can be modeled and visualized using Python. We use NumPy for simplicity and PyTorch for gradient-based control.

1. Simulating Entropy Evolution With Observation History

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def shannon_entropy(p):
    return -np.sum(p * np.log(p + 1e-12))

def observe_and_collapse(p, observed_index, collapse_strength=0.8):
    """Modify p based on observation (DEM II-style collapse)"""
    p_new = p.copy()
    p_new[observed_index] *= collapse_strength
    p_new = p_new / np.sum(p_new)  # re-normalize
    return p_new

# Initial uniform distribution over 5 states
p = np.ones(5) / 5
entropy_values = [shannon_entropy(p)]

# Simulate entropy evolution with observations
for t in range(20):
    observed = np.random.choice(len(p))
    p = observe_and_collapse(p, observed)
    entropy_values.append(shannon_entropy(p))

plt.plot(entropy_values)
plt.title("Entropy Collapse Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Time Step")
plt.ylabel("Entropy H(t)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

Interpretation: This shows how repeated observer interaction (random observations) drives entropy reduction—mimicking a measurement-induced collapse.

2. Entropy Feedback Control With PyTorch

Here we model a simple probability distribution \mathbf{p}(t), and use an entropy gradient to push it toward a target distribution \mathbf{p}^*.

import torch

# Initialize probability distribution
p = torch.tensor([0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], requires_grad=True)
target = torch.tensor([0.05, 0.05, 0.8, 0.05, 0.05])
lambda_control = 0.1
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([p], lr=0.1)

entropy_trajectory = []

for step in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    # Ensure p remains a valid distribution
    p_soft = torch.softmax(p, dim=0)
    
    # Compute KL divergence as control objective (Lyapunov-like)
    kl = torch.sum(p_soft * torch.log(p_soft / target))
    kl.backward()
    
    # Gradient descent step toward low-entropy / target
    optimizer.step()
    entropy = -torch.sum(p_soft * torch.log(p_soft)).item()
    entropy_trajectory.append(entropy)

plt.plot(entropy_trajectory)
plt.title("Entropy Under Feedback Control")
plt.xlabel("Iteration")
plt.ylabel("Entropy H(t)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

Interpretation: Entropy gradually decreases as feedback control pushes \mathbf{p}(t) toward the desired configuration (collapse).

3. Visualizing Bias Emergence

This example simulates how repeated feedback and environmental perturbations push the system into a biased (non-uniform) distribution.

def entropy_bias_simulation(steps=100):
    states = 5
    p = np.ones(states) / states
    history = [p.copy()]
    
    for _ in range(steps):
        obs = np.random.choice(states, p=p)
        env_perturb = np.random.rand(states) * 0.05
        p = observe_and_collapse(p, obs, 0.7) + env_perturb
        p = p / np.sum(p)
        history.append(p.copy())
    
    return np.array(history)

history = entropy_bias_simulation()
for i in range(history.shape[1]):
    plt.plot(history[:, i], label=f"State {i}")
    
plt.title("Bias Emergence in Open System")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Probability")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

Interpretation: Originally equal-probability states diverge due to entropic interactions and external perturbations, illustrating DEM II’s emergent bias model.

Planned Next Steps for Expansion
	•	Implement dynamic Fokker–Planck simulation using finite differences.
	•	Integrate DEM II with reinforcement learning agents for policy regularization.
	•	Extend control to multi-agent systems for entropy-aligned coordination.
